1. (Tricky) One might imagine a variant of the interchange law that says something about applying a pure function to an effectful argument. Using the above laws, prove that

LAWS :-

I   : pure id <*> v = v                             Identity
II  : pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)                Homomorphism
III : u <*> pure y = pure (\f -> f y) <*> u         Interchange
IV  : u <*> (v <*> w) = pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w  Composition

pure f <*> x = pure (flip ($)) <*> x <*> pure f

Ans.
RHS = pure (flip ($)) <*> x <*> pure f

LHS = pure f <*> x

-- 2. Implement an instance of Applicative for Maybe.

instance Applicative Maybe where
  -- pure :: a -> Maybe a
  pure = Just

  -- (<*>) :: Maybe (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
  Just g <*> Just x = Just (g x)
  Nothing <*> _ = Nothing

-- 3. Determine the correct definition of pure for the ZipList instance of Applicativeâ€”there is only one implementation that satisfies the law relating pure and (<*>).
